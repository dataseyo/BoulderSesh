### Session Logic: 

A SessionList component stores the state of all the sessions, and maps them to a SessionCard UI component. Each SessionCard stores the state of the sessions boulders, which are shown when a user presses the SessionCard and navigates to the SessionInstance page via nested navigation. The Session Instance page displays the boulders and allows users to add more boulders to that session.
